#### Who is not buying from minimart?

Observe the following data: [https://github.com/mafudge/datasets/tree/master/minimart](https://github.com/mafudge/datasets/tree/master/minimart)

You have been hired to build a UI to display names of customers who did not buy from minimart in any given month.

Provide a Streamlit UI with a drop down selection for the month. (jan, feb, mar, apr)

It then outputs a dataframe of customers who did not buy anything in that month. 


**HINT**

Access the raw data from this base url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/refs/heads/master/minimart/`
