Number to Letter grade
Letter grades in a college class are computed as follows:

95 and above is an A
75 and above, but below 95 is a B
50 and above, but below 75 is a C
below 50 is F
Write a program to input the number grade and calculate the letter grade

Re-write to account for "bad" grades > 120 or < 0
